This directory contains the files used in the main MCMC simulation in 
"Drifts and Volatilities ..." by Cogley and Sargent (2005).  Many of 
the other results can be computed by changing the variable ordering or
turning off the rejection sample.  

DelNegro (2003) outlines some modifications that will speed up the 
algorithm.  Primiceri (2002) discusses an extension of the stochastic 
volatility specification that allows one to make contact with some 
models in the structural VAR literature.  



The main file is BVARSVOL3B.M, which runs the simulation and calls
all the other files.

The data are stored in NEWQDATA.MAT.

BAYESREG.M executes a Bayesian regression.  This is used for the 
covariance parameters B.

CHOFAC.M copies these parameters from a vector into a lower triangular
matrix.

FIGS2.M produces many of the figures in the paper.

GIBBS1.M simulates the VAR parameters using the forward filter, 
backward sampler approach of Carter and Kohn.  It uses outputs 
generated by the files KFR.M, which is a Kalman-filter routine.

GIBBS2Q.M simulates an inverse-Wishart matrix.  Here it is used for
Q, the covariance matrix for theta innovations.  It takes as input
the scale matrix and degree of freedom parameter produced by IWPQ.M.

IG2.M generates a draw from an inverse-gamma density.  This is used
for part of the stochastic volatility model.

INNOVM.M calculates the innovations for the measurement equation.

SUR.M calculates a seemingly unrelated regression.  This is used for
initial estimates. 

The files SVMH.M, SVMH0.M, and SVMHT.M generate metropolis-hastings 
draws for the stochastic volatilities.  The latter two refer to the
beginning and end points of the sample, respectively, and the first
works for interior points

XMAT.M takes data on lagged dependent variables and transforms them
into a convenient tensor.
